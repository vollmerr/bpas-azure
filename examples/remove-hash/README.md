# Examples - remove-hash
This example uses the 'development' environment, which is the default environment. To try a different environment replace all occurances of 'development' with that environment.

1. Optionally change the `DEPLOY_FOLDER` to a different folder to remove hashes from
2. Use `npm run remove-hash:development`
3. The files should be renamed to `file.js` and `style.css` in the folder targeted by `DEPLOY_FOLDER` (dist by default)
4. To run again, replace the contents of the folder targeted by `DEPLOY_FOLDER` with the contents of the `copy` folder
